### A Django app to use on my pesonal server so interact with ollama

#### **The Story Behind The Build**
rebuilding my home server, a literal potatoe juiced up with a 1060 (lol). i had a docker container running for jellyfin gpu encoding the whole nine yards. however i decided to try and and get a local ai hosted. thats where things went bad... containerizing Ollama was easy, however Openweb UI would not stop hanging up on start up and using too much cpu power. so rightfully so i ask ChatGPT what i should do. And the bastard called me out and said "you're a developer arent you, build it yourself". So im ATTEMPTING to build something.... so it runs on my potato haha
